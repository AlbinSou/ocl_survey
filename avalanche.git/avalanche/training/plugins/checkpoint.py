class CheckpointPlugin(BaseSGDPlugin[BaseSGDTemplate]):
    """
    A checkpointing facility that can be used to persist the entire state of the
    strategy (including its model, plugins, metrics, loggers, etcetera).

    This strategy plugin will store a checkpoint after each evaluation phase.

    Using this plugin required minor changes to the usual Avalanche main script.
    Please refer to the `task_incremental_with_checkpointing.py` example for a
    simple guide on how to use this plugin.

    The checkpoint is stored using the :class:`CheckpointStorage` object
    provided in the input. The :class:`FileSystemCheckpointStorage` is the
    simpler option, but more sophisticated storage mechanisms can be used
    (based on W&B, S3, etcetera).

    This implementation sends a pickled version of the strategy object to the
    checkpoint storage. The strategy object is pickled using `dill`, which
    is a powerful drop-in replacement of pickle supported by PyTorch.

    This class also adds the ability to load a checkpoint by using a different
    target device than the one used when producing the checkpoint. In other
    words, this plugin adds the ability to load a cuda checkpoint to CPU,
    or to load a checkpoint created on cuda:1 to cuda:0. See the `map_location`
    parameter of the constructor for more details.

    Critical objects such as loggers are pickled as well, but the whole process
    is managed carefully to avoid errors. Datasets are pickled as well, but
    for datasets like torchvision ones, that load the whole content of the
    dataset in-memory, a custom pickling method is provided by Avalanche out
    of the box, so there is no need to worry about the checkpoint size. The
    replay plugin already uses the subset operation to manage the replay,
    which means that no dataset elements are actually saved to checkpoints.

    However, this will also mean that the main script must correctly re-create
    the benchmark object when loading a checkpoint. This is usually not a big
    deal as random number generators state are saved and loaded as well.

            In addition, all `torch.device` objects will be un-pickled using
